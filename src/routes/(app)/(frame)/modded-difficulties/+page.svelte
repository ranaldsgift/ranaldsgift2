				<p>
					A difficulty mutator that introduces more elites in hordes, changes the enemy composition of hordes, and also speeds up
					the pacing of a match which makes hordes and specials appear much more frequently. Events are reworked on every map to
					increase difficulty, and occasionally completely new events are added in. There are no empty boss/patrol triggers in
					Onslaught. Onslaught was created by Grimalackt.

					A difficulty mutator that aims to provide a more difficult experience than regular Onslaught. ONS+ introduces more
					elites in hordes, as well as shield units, and some waves include Chaos Warriors. The mod increases the amount of
					ambients that can spawn too. The main changes are related to map triggers and events, so expect larger patrols and more
					bosses. OnslaughtPlus was created by Iceolator.

					A mutator mod in the same vein as Onslaught made by Core specifically for the Onslaught Series. This is the difficulty
					second only to Spicy Onslaught; "Spice the average Dutchie can handle". There are a lot of spawns in Dutch Spice, most
					notably vastly increased Special spawns. Custom enemies are also introduced, such as White Stormvermin, which are normal
					SV but with super armour type and Bestigor HP.

					A difficulty modifier that increases enemy stagger resistances, and Globadier gas damage. Elites can no longer be
					interrupted out of their overheads with a majority of the classes in the game, and enemies in general tend to stay
					stunned for a much shorter period of time. Stagger damage multipliers are locked at C1 values (less damage dealt to
					staggered enemies in C3). Deathwish was originally created by Grimalackt, but it is now updated and maintained by
					RandomWords with input from the community.
